# CodingBat Website UI Redesign 🎨

This is a complete UI/UX redesign concept of [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com), a platform for practicing Python and Java problems.

## 🔍 About This Project

CodingBat is powerful for coding practice but has an outdated UI. I redesigned it focusing on:
- Cleaner layout
- Clearer call-to-actions
- Better focus for beginners and students
- Modern, responsive design using minimal purple-white theme
